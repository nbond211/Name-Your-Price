# Name Your Price
A Node.js web application that scrapes data from Bandcamp to find good free music.

I love discovering independent and hobbyist artists who release their music for free through Bandcamp. Unfortunately, the website offers no way to filter music by price, so I created this application to automate the process of finding freely available albums.

The application relies on Node.js and Cheerio to scrape Bandcamp for musoc albums listed as free. The menu system for interaction with the API is built with AngluarJS.
