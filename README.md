# Name-Your-Price
A Node.js web application that scrapes data from Bandcamp to find good free music.

I love discovering independent and hobbyist artists who release their music for free through Bandcamp. Unfortunately, the website offers no way to filter music by price, so I created this application to automate the process of finding freely available albums.
